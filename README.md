# Welcome to Tank Tycoon!

This is Nathan Kim's and Matthew Seo's CS Data Structures Project

Tank Tycoon is a tycoon game where you get more fish over time and make as much money as you can through tank upgrades. 

## Instructions:

- Start with base amount of money and buy your first fish!
- Money will start to spawn and you can either click with left mouse button or wait for one of your fish to run into it.
- Each dollar found will be worth $5
- Continue this until you get to buy a shark for your aquarium!

## Responses:
- What Data Structures were used?
```
A tree structure was used for the scene tree. Additionally, we used a dictionary to store the various fish and their corresponding value.
